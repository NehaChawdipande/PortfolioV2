This is a basic spline + react.js portfolio.

THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS

I have embedded interative spline scenes into a react application.
There are 2 spline views, One for mobile views and another for tablet screen sizes and above.

You can visit the link : https://spline-portfolio.on-fleek.app/ to check the latest deployed version of the portfolio

Here are a few pictures:
